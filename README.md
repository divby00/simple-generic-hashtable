# simple-generic-hashtable

This is a very simple hashtable that can be used to store any kind of information through the
use of function pointers. In this example it is working for strings, but you can define your own
functions to customize the creation and deletion of any object. Check the behaviour of
hashtable_string_create and hashtable_string_destroy functions.
